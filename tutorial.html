            <p>
              On every model, there is a small magnifying glass icon on the top
              left. To learn more about one specific model, click on this
              magnifying glass and an informational panel will appear.

            <p>
              The informational panel tells you the name of the model you are
              viewing, and below the name, are the details of the model you are
              viewing.

              If there are additional notes for the model, they will be shown
              under the details window. You are able to view the size of the
              SimVascular Project <code>.zip</code> files as well.

              If simulation results are avaliable for the model, you will be
              able to choose which file type you want to download. As you change
              the file type, the displayed size will update.

            <p>
              Instead of downloading or creating shareable links for individual
              models, you may want to work with multiple models at once.
            </p>
            <p>
              To select and deselect a model to add it to or remove it from your
              collection of models, simply click or unclick on the model's
              image.
            </p>
            <img

            <p>
              The example above demonstrates where to click and what a selected
              model looks like.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also select multiple models at once with the Select All
              icon in the menu bar. For more information on this feature, go to

            </p>
            <p>
              To view the models you have selected, click on the View Selected

              If what you are looking for is too specific, an error message may
              appear. If so, it means the specific models you are searching for
              are not currently avaliable in our repository. You may need to
              enter in fewer specifications into the filter for models to appear
              in the gallery.

              In the example above, an error message has appeared. This is
              because the Vascular Model Repository does not currently contain
              models that are of pulmonary arteries that have undergone the
              coronary artery bypass graft procedure.

            <p>To apply the filters, click or unclick a checkbox.</p>

            <p>
              In the example above, the models that are a result of the checkbox
              entries are of aortas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some models check off more than one box per category. However,
              selecting more than one option under a category will return the
              union of those entries. To search for models that specifically
              have 2+ entries under one category, you will find the search bar
              to be more helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Between categories (such as "Anatomy" and "Disease"), the
              checkboxes act as an intersection of the entries.

            <p>
              In the example above, the models that are a result of the checkbox
              entries are either of aortas with aneurysm(s) or of coronary
              arteries with aneurysm(s).

              A few models do not contain certain files. With the Project Must

              have the files you are looking to download.

              The size displayed under the drop down menu changes dynamically

            <p>There are two ways to get the link to share a model.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The first way to get a link to share one model is by clicking on
                the share icon when viewing a model. To find how to view this
                informational panel, go to
                <a href="#Viewing_model_details">viewing model details</a>.

                By clicking on this icon, you will copy the link to share the
                model. The link may look something like
                <a
                  style="word-wrap: break-word"
                  href="https://www.vascularmodel.com/share.html?NzlOWTI3Tg__"

              <br />
              <li>
                The other way to get a link to share one model is to click on
                the Get Shareable Link icon when you only have one model
                selected.
                <img

              Below the name and image is more information about the model.
              Here, you can also know the size of the model's SimVascular
