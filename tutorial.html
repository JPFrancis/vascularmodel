            <p>
              If what you are looking for is too specific, an error message may
              appear. If so, it means the specific models you are searching for
              are not currently avaliable in our repository. You may need to
              enter in fewer specifications into the filter for models to appear
              in the gallery.
            </p>

            />
            <p>
              In the example above, an error message has appeared. This is
              because the Vascular Model Repository does not currently contain
              models that are of pulmonary arteries that have undergone the
              coronary artery bypass graft procedure.

              If you want to return to the default state of the dataset gallery,

              that are currently applied.

            <p>
              If you want to collapse all the filter menus, click on the
              Collapse All Button. It will do so. Clicking this button, however,
              will not clear the filters that are applied.

              In the example above, the collapse all button has been pressed,
              which collapses all the filter headers. The filters remain
              applied.

            <p>
              With the search bar, you are able to search for specific models.
              To search for multiple characteristics, add a space between each
              characteristic. To apply the filter, write in an entry and hit the
              ENTER key.

              In the example above, the models that are a result of the search
              bar entry are all male models of aortas that have aneurysms.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are looking for one specific model, you can search for the
              name of the model in the search bar.
            </p>
            <h4 id="The_Simulation_Results_Filter">The Simulation Results Filter</h4>
            <p>
              We have ran simulations for some of the models in this repository.
              They come in <code>.vtu</code> and <code>.vtp</code> files. This
              filter allows you to search for those models.
            </p>
            <img

            <p>
              Above is what the default for the simulation results button is. In
              this state, no models are being filtered for simulation results.
            </p>
            <p>
              To apply this filter, click on the mode you want to be in. If
              "MUST HAVE" is showing, you are filtering for the models that have
              simulation results. If "OPTIONAL" is showing, you are not
              filtering for simulation results.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the example above, the models that are the result of clicking
              the simulation results button have downloadable
              <code>.vtu</code> and <code>.vtp</code> files.
            </p>
            <h4 id="The_Age_Filter">The Age Filter</h4>
            <p>
              With the filter for age, you are able to search within an age
              range. The current minimum for the filter is 0 years of age, and
              the current maximum is 120 years.
            </p>

            <p>
              Both the minimum and maximum bounds are inclusive. To apply the
              filter, hit the ENTER key.
            </p>
            <img

            <p>
              In the example above, the models that are a result of the age
              filter entries are 5 years old.

            <p>
              With the two drop down menus, you are able to search for models of
              a specific sex and species. To apply the filters, select the
              subcategory you are looking for.
            </p>
            <!-- <img src="img/help/" alt="Image of what "> -->

            <p>
              In the example above, the models that are a result of the drop
              down menu entries are both female and human.
            </p>
            <p>
              To deselect a drop down menu entry without clearing all applied
              filters, click on the "Select One" option.
            </p>

            <p>Here is what the reset drop down menu should look like:</p>

            <h4 id="The_Checkboxes">The Checkboxes</h4>
            <p>
              With checkboxes under the three categories "Anatomy," "Disease,"
              and "Procedure," you are able to search for models of a specific
              anatomy, disease, or surgical procedure.
            </p>
            <p>To apply the filters, click or unclick a checkbox.</p>
            <img
              src="img/help/checkboxExZ.jpg"
              alt="Image of what an applied check box looks like."
            />
            <img
              src="img/help/checkboxEx.jpg"
              alt="Image of what the gallery looks like with the applied checkbox"
            />
            <p>
              In the example above, the models that are a result of the checkbox
              entries are of aortas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some models check off more than one box per category. However,
              selecting more than one option under a category will return the
              union of those entries. To search for models that specifically
              have 2+ entries under one category, you will find the search bar
              to be more helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Between categories (such as "Anatomy" and "Disease"), the
              checkboxes act as an intersection of the entries.

              In the example above, the models that are a result of the checkbox
              entries are either of aortas with aneurysm(s) or of coronary
              arteries with aneurysm(s).

            <h4 id="The_Project_Must_Contain_Filter">The Project Must Contain Filter</h4>
            <p>
              A few models do not contain certain files. With the Project Must
              Contain filter, you are able to filter through the models that
              have the files you are looking to download.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike the filter above, these checkboxes act as intersections. To
              apply the filters, click or unclick a checkbox.
            </p>

              file.

              There are different ways to find what you are searching for in the
              Vascular Model Repository. If you are looking for a specific
              model, the search bar is the most effective. If you are looking
              for models in specific categories, the other forms of filters will
              be the most helpful.

            with unique functions to help you navigate the Vascular Model
            Repository's dataset. The functions of each of these icons are
            described below.

              In the example above, by clicking the Select All icon, all the
              models in the repository have been selected.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you are viewing the models you have selected, a place you can
              access by clicking on the View Selected Models icon, clicking the
              Select All icon will deselect all the models you have selectd. A
              confirmation message will appear. By clicking "Yes," you are able

              After selecting models, you may want to view all the models you
              have selected before downloading their files. To do so, find the
              view selected models icon, the top right icon, in the menu bar and
              click on it.
            </p>
            <p>The number on the icon is how many models you have selected.</p>

              filters to return to the gallery.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you are viewing the models you have selected, you can see how
              many you have selected on the top-middle of the screen.

            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>.vtp</code> and <code>.vtu</code> files are simulation

            <p>
              Not all models have simulation results. If you choose to download
              the files from our simulation results, the box will inform you how
              many of the models you have selected have simulation results to
              download.

              In the example above, 2 out of the 3 models selected have
              simulation results to donwload.
            </p>
            <p>
              The size displayed under the drop down menu changes dynamically
              with the file type you have chosen. It represents the total sizes
              of the models you have selected to download.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you are ready to download the models of the file type you
              have selected, click "Yes" and the files will begin downloading.
