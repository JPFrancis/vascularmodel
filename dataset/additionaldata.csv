SVCardiacDemoModel,"This data can be used to demonstrate the automatic left ventricle model construction capability of SimVascular. The model construction pipeline includes machine-learning-based whole heart segmentation, surface editing, registration, and meshing techniques to automatically construct simulation-ready LV meshes and boundary conditions from modeling of the LV hemodynamics.
